# IIRSProject
Underwater image processing and orpthophoto/point cloud  generation.

Developed a software tool for automating the 3D surface generation of the seabed. The task included the following objectives:

* Extracting frames from an underwater ROV footage.
* Geo-tagging the extracted frames with GPS data(provided).
* Enhancing the extracted frames using image processing algorithms.
* Generating Digital Elevation Model and Orthophoto using OpenDroneMap.

Languages used: Java, Bash, Python.
